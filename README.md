# Readme Projet Allez-Cine
## Description
Creation of a one page using HTML, CSS, a CSS framework, Bootstrap, Javascript and the Jquery library.
This project makes heavy uses of a JSONs and ajax request serving as a pseudo database to display movies in the featured section and in the shop section of the page.

The project also uses a randomizing function on the JSON to display the movies on  the all tab of the featured section to change which movies are displayed each time the all button is hit or when the page is reloaded.
